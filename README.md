# Integration between Axis devices and Azure

## Introduction

[Axis Developer Documentation](https://developer.axis.com/) serves as a comprehensive resource hub for developers and solution builders aiming to build applications tailored for Axis network-connected devices.

[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) is a platform in the cloud that provides highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure to individuals, companies, and governments.

This repository focuses on providing examples where we create the integration between the Axis device and Azure.
